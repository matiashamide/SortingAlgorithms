### SortingAlgorithms
   
This is a personal project for myself to self teach how these algorithms work in a low level development and to understand the difference between each and to understand the way databases sort big sets of data.   

This code is not perfect by any means, but it is honest work. It can be better optimized by coding in a lower level language such as C or C++, but i wanted to understand how these algorithms work and understand the different *algorithm complexities* by comparing how they perform in big sets of data and tryied to optimize some of them.
